Doing Advent Of Code for the first time.

And I am taking this opportunity to learn Java. Why? hmmm 🤔, because why not.... I mean it runs across 3 billion devices 😀

So, yes this year it will be in Java 😃

If you would like to contribute, please do so 😊

If you have any feedbacks for me regarding any code of mine here, please please do so as well. I would highly appreciate that 😍

Thank you for checking out! 🙏
